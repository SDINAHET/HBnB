# Introduction to Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

In this phase of the HBnB project, you'll implement the core functionality of the application using Python and Flask. This will involve building the Presentation and Business logic layers, and defining essential classes, methods and API endpoints, based on the design developed in the previous part.

The goal is to bring the documented architecture to life by creating the project structure, develop the business logic, and implement key functionality such as managing users, places, reviews, and amenities.

## Project Vision and Scope

This part is focused on creating a functional and scalable foundation for the application. You will be working on:

- **Business Logic Layer:** Building the core models and logic that drive the application's functionality. This includes defining relationships, handling data validation, and managing interactions between different components.

- **Presentation Layer:** Defining the services and API endpoints using Flask and `flask-restx`. You will structure the endpoints logically, ensuring clear paths and parameters for each operation.

## Learning Objectives

This part of the project is designed to help you achieve the following learning outcomes:

1. **Set Up the Project Structure:**

    - Organize the project into a modular architecture, following best practices for Python and Flask applications.
    - Create the necessary packages for the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

2. **Implement the Business Logic Layer:**

    Understand how to translate documented designs into working code by:

    - Develop the core classes for the business logic, including User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities.
    - Implement relationships between entities and define how they interact within the application.
    - Implement the facade pattern to simplify communication between the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

3. **Build RESTful API Endpoints:**

    - Implement the necessary API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities.
    - Use `flask-restx` to define and document the API, ensuring a clear and consistent structure.
    - Implement data serialization to return extended attributes for related objects. For example, when retrieving a Place, the API should include details such as the owner's `first_name`, `last_name`, and relevant amenities.

4. **Test and Validate the API:**

    - Write tests to validate the behavior of the business logic classes.
    - Ensure that the API responses are consistent with the expected behavior.
    - Ensure that each endpoint works correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.
